<path>

Path Commands:
- MoveTo: M, m (M is used to set the absolute coordinate from (0,0) cartesian coordinate, while m is to set coordinate, which is relative to the last coordinate for example coordinate (10, 10) will move from coordinate (0,0))
- LineTo: L, l, H, h, V, v
- Cubic Bezier Curve: C, c, S, s
- Quadratic Bezier Curve: Q, q, T, t
- Elliptical Arc Curve: A, a

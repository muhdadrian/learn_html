# span and div have no meaning

# h1 vs span in displaying Hello World for example. Use h1 as it's more semantic

Why we must write semantically?
1. Accessibility (conveniently read by user)
2. Maintainability (conveniently read by developer)
3. SEO (conveniently read by search engine)

Why we must write semantically (in details)?
1. HTML should be written to represent data to be displayed not based on style (how it's displayed - size, color etc) for example use p for paragraph, use button for button.
2. For accessibility for those using screen reader (disabled people).
3. As a developer, it's easier for us to search and organize code that has meaning.
4. It's influential on SEO, as HMTL semantic is considered as important keyword   

The category of HTML5 element:
1. Metadata: 
Metadata content - base, link, meta, noscript, script, style, template, title - to describe about our website info, and what contained in metadata are not displayed in the web 
2. Flow:
a, abbr, address, area, article, aside, audio, b, bdi, bdo, blockquote, br, button, canvas, cite, code, data, date, datalist, del, details, dfn, dialog, div, dl, em, embed, fieldset, figure, footer, form, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, header, hgroup, hr, i, iframe, img, input, ins, kbd, keygen, label, link, main, map, mark, math, menu, meta, meter, nav, noscript, object, ol, output, p, picture, pre, progress, q, ruby, s, samp, script, section, select, slot, small, span, strong, sub, sup, svg, table, template, textarea, time, u, ul, var, video, wbr, autonomous custom elements. Text   
3. Sectioning: 
article, aside, nav, section - before HMTL5 there's div with class header, footer etc
4. Heading:
h1 to h6, hgroup - to write title
5. Phrasing:
a, abbr, area, audio, b, bdi, bdo, br, button, canvas, cite, code, data, date, datalist, del, dfn, em, embed, i, iframe, img, input, ins, kbd, keygen, label, link, map, mark, math, meta, meter, noscript, object, output, picture, progress, q, ruby, s, samp, script, select, slot, small, span, strong, sub, sup, svg, template, textarea, time, u, var, video, wbr, autonomous custom elements, Text
-to explain info in our website 
6. Embedded:
audio, canvas, embed, iframe, img, math, object, picture, svg, video
- multi-media elements to be put inside our website
7. Interactive:
a, audio, button, details, embed, iframe, img, input, keygen, label, object, select, textarea, video
- interactive content

# HTML5 is semantic by using header, section etc compared to HTML4 that only using div with header etc classes
 
What are the examples of element HMTL5 semantic (read MDN for further explanation)?
1. <main>
2. <nav>
3. <section>
4. <header>
5. <footer>
6. <article>

If we want to add semantic for non-semactic element to be read well by screen reader for accesibility:
By using WAI-ARIA - Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications -   

<div id="navigation" role="navigation"></div>

- the div above can be explained by using role="navigation" to make it more semantic for non-semantic element. You can even add more info:

<div id="navigation" role="navigation" aria-label="my-main-navigation"></div>div

# try to change div above to nav which is semantic.

# src:
- compulsory attribute
- path to photo folder
- photo types: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, svg, webp (optimized for web), avif (optimized for web)
- better use own photo. If other people's, then check its copyright
- don't do hotlinking by linking other people's photos in their websites - it will cause us to take their bandwidth and we do not have control of the photos if they took down the photo.

# alt:
- alternative text
- textual description of a photo
- use when the photo cannot be displayed due to typo in writing path and slow connection.
- for screen reader (accessibility).
- for SEO - our web will be more recognized by search engine
- always use alt - SG.
- if in URL, write its url link

# width & height:
- to determine photo size (but not recommended to do in HTML but CSS)

# title
- to write additional info about the photo.
- to add tooltip when the mouse hover on the photo.
- it's additional from alt. Do not use title if there's no alt, as title not read by screen reader.

# srcset
- to make responsive web page
- to choose different photo based on specific condition
- it could be based on web width or pixel  
- you need to refresh the browser to return the photo in small size (please check)
-  srcset="img/small.jpg 500w, img/medium.jpg 750w, img/large.jpg 1000w" - we change the w to px:
 srcset="img/small.jpg 1x, img/medium.jpg 2x, img/large.jpg 3x" - this will be displayed in retina - to see the result, right click and inspect - click to see in dimension - add device pixel ratio in three dots and see in DPR - refresh each time you change from 1 to 3

***************************

 # sizes
 - to organize different photo size based on 'media condition' - we normally do this in CSS, but now HTML also has this by using sizes attribute
 - sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 50vw" - when the screen reached 1200px, it will be half in  viewport width (1200/2=600), therefore the photo to be displayed is the medium size (500 to 750) and not the large size anymore.
- how to read after adding the sizes?:
small till 500, medium till 750, large till 1200 and return back to medium when it reached 1200 with half view port width

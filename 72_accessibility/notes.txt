Web Accessibility:
1. Do realistic DOM structure. How? Answer in 2.
2. Use semantic element. Don't overuse unneccesary div and span. Only use when 'darurat' (7 below).
3. Use interactive control. If you want to use button, use button element or anchor, don't use div or span as interactive element. Screen reader does not think div / span as control.
4. Use label for all control and images.
5. Apply intuitive focus on management.
6. Website can be fully accessed only by using keyboard.
7. Use ARIA when needed.  

DOM Tree (read by user) vs Accessibility Tree (read by screen reader).

If we do not create good DOM Tree, then its Accessibility Tree also is not good.
